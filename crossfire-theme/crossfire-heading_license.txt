        You have the right to copy this work of art for your personal use, for your friends or for any other person, by employing whatever technique you choose.

            attach this license, in its entirety, to the copies or indicate precisely where the license can be found,
            specify to the recipient the name of the author of the originals,
            specify to the recipient where he will be able to access the originals (original and subsequent). The author of the original may, if he wishes, give you the right to broadcast/distribute the original under the same conditions as the copies.
        3. FREEDOM TO MODIFY
        You have the right to modify the copies of the originals (original and subsequent), partially or otherwise, respecting the conditions set out in article
        In the event of distribution (or representation) of the modified copy. The author of the original may, if he wishes, give you the right to modify the original under the same conditions as the copies.
3. YOUR AUTHOR'S RIGHTS
    The object of this license is not to deny your author's rights on your contribution. By choosing to contribute to the evolution of this work of art, you only agree to give to others the same rights with regard to your contribution as those which were granted to you by this license.
4. DURATION OF THE LICENCE
    This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its provisions. The fact of copying, distributing, or of modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement. This license will remain in force for as long as the copyright which is attached to the work of art. If you do not respect the terms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it confers. If the legal status to which you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.
5. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENCE
    This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by its authors (instigators of the "copyleft attitude" movement) by way of new, numbered versions. You will have the choice of accepting the provisions contained in the version under which the copy was communicated to you, or alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent versions.
6. SUB-LICENSING
    Sub-licenses are not authorized by the present license. Any person who wishes to make use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the author of the original work.
7. THE LAW APPLICABLE TO THIS CONTRACT
    This license is subject to Belgian law.
